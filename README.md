# muslim-prayer-earth

Muslims pray 5 times a day, these 5 daily prayers' timings are decided by the sun's location, with prayers in the evening, the sunset, and in between.

These prayers provide a spiritual connection between every Muslim and their lord and serve as reminders for all of them to abstain from sin and to fear Allah as well as serve as a break from worldly matters.
