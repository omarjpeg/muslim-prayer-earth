# muslim-prayer-earth

Muslims pray 5 times a day, these 5 daily prayers' timings are decided by the sun's location, with prayers in the evening, the sunset, and in between.

These prayers provide a spiritual connection between every Muslim and their lord and serve as reminders for all of them to abstain from sin and to fear Allah as well as serve as a break from worldly matters.

Visualized below, the call for prayer is called along every line along the earth's vertical axis from pole to pole!
